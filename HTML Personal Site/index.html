        <p>I was born in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the capital of Tenerife, one of the bigget island along the canary archipelago. I had studied in a school at La Laguna, the 2nd largest city in the island and I have been playing at the school
          basketball
          team for more than 13 years. I decided to study the Social Science course because of my interest for the Business Administration world and thankfully I am currently studying what I like most.
          By the way, I am having a self-teaching plan on Web developing because its undoubtly the future so all the next models of business will be related with all these stuff</p>
